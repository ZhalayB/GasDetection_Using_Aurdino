# GasDetection_Using_Aurdino
A gas detection system using Arduino is an electronic device designed to detect the presence of specific gases in the surrounding environment. It employs various sensors to monitor gas levels and alerts users when gas concentrations exceed predefined thresholds, helping to prevent potential hazards such as leaks or exposure to harmful gases.
